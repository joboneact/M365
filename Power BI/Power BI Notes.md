Power BI Notes



Planner Tasks Load.pq
How it works:

Loads your Planner JSON export.
Expands each task and assigned user into a flat table.
The result is a table with columns: id, title, dueDate, bucketId, userId, displayName, and email.
You can further filter, group, or transform this data as needed in Power BI or Excel Power Query.
